# Android-Paging-3-with-CRUD-using-MVVM
This project demonstrates the implementation of Android Paging 3 Library with Remote Mediator using MVVM architecture with Room and Retrofit. It also implements CRUD with paging 3 and uses RecylerView and Used Quotes Public API.

The project is divided into three main modules:

1. The app module contains the main application logic. It uses the MVVM architecture and Room and Retrofit libraries to implement the paging 3 library.
2. The data module contains the data layer. It uses the Room library to implement a local database for storing quotes. It also uses the Retrofit library to fetch quotes from the Quotes Public API.
3. The ui module contains the user interface. It uses the RecylerView library to display a list of quotes.
